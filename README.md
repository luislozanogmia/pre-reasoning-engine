# Pre-Reasoning

Pre-Reasoning is a Mia Labs structural analysis engine that grounds an LLM before it answers. It uses a 13.7M trainable parameter MoE neural model to surface dependencies, derived assumptions, root blockers, unlock order, parallel work, cycles, and conflicts from problem text.

The engine ships with bundled weights and declares its torch dependency; install and run, no model download needed.

## What It Does

Given natural-language problem text, the engine extracts structure across five learned families:

| Family | What it detects | Output |
|---|---|---|
| F1 - Dependencies | Forward/reverse dependencies, temporal ordering, chains | ROOT BLOCKERS, UNLOCK SEQUENCE, PARALLEL WORK, CYCLES |
| F2 - Conflicts | Competing positions, incompatible entities | CONFLICTS with pair precision |
| F3 - Requirements | Numeric thresholds, operator constraints (>=, <=) | REQUIREMENTS with verdict |
| F4 - Conditionals | If-then edges, gated dependencies | CONDITIONAL EDGES with entity binding |
| F5 - Transitive Closure | Implicit assumptions from dependency chains | DERIVED ASSUMPTIONS (built-in E4 expert) |

## Install

```bash
pip install pre-reasoning
```

For local development from this repo:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

## Python Usage

```python
from pre_reasoning import analyze, pulse

result = analyze("Frontend depends on API. API depends on Auth.")
print(result["trace"])

check = pulse(
    "Frontend depends on API. API depends on Auth.",
    "Fix Auth first, then verify the API before frontend work."
)
print(check["status"])
```

## CLI Usage

```bash
pre-reasoning "A depends on B. B depends on C."
pre-reasoning --json "CTO conflicts with senior dev."
pre-reasoning --info
```

To use a different weights file, set `PRE_REASONING_CHECKPOINT=/path/to/weights.safetensors` or pass `--checkpoint`.

## Eval Results: 35/35 PASS

The 13.7M trainable parameter MoE model passes all 35 metrics across five families. 2,250 eval examples, seed 7777.

| Family | Metrics | Score |
|---|---:|---:|
| F1 - Dependencies | 9 | 9/9 |
| F2 - Conflicts | 4 | 4/4 |
| F3 - Requirements | 5 | 5/5 |
| F4 - Conditionals | 4 | 4/4 |
| F5 - Transitive Closure | 4 | 4/4 |
| Cross-Family Integrity | 9 | 9/9 |
| **Total** | **35** | **35/35** |

## Terminal-Bench 2: 34/40 (85%)

LLM grounding benchmark on 40 real coding tasks (Harbor 0.15.0). GPT-5.5 agent with autonomous pre-reasoning (min 12 blocks, pulse every 60s).

| | Value |
|---|---|
| Score | 34/40 (85%) |
| Model | GPT-5.5 |
| Total runtime | 492 min |
| Total API cost | $102.50 |
| Failures | torch-tensor-parallelism, gcode-to-text, make-doom-for-mips (timeout), gpt2-codegolf (timeout), polyglot-rust-c, filter-js-from-html |

## Architecture

```text
User text
  -> neural perception (13.7M MoE)
  -> neural findings converted to structural blocks
  -> built-in E4 expert infers transitive closure assumptions
  -> derived assumptions appended as dependency blocks
  -> graph reasoning
  -> structural trace
```

## Weights Policy

The raw training checkpoint is not part of the release. The package bundles `pre_reasoning/checkpoints/pre-reasoning-12m-v3.safetensors`. This is an inference artifact with 13.7M trainable parameters. The file contains 22.1M tensor values because it also stores fixed causal attention masks. It ships no optimizer state, LR schedules, step counters, RNG state, training config, or raw checkpoint provenance.
